# Legacy Files

This directory contains the original Claude Code SDK implementation files. They have been replaced by the OpenCode Python SDK versions in the main directory.

## Files

- `agent.py` - Original Claude SDK agent logic
- `client.py` - Original Claude SDK client configuration  
- `autonomous_agent_demo.py` - Original main entry point
- `test_opencode_sdk.py` - OpenCode SDK test file

## Status

These files are kept for reference and rollback purposes. The active implementation now uses OpenCode Python SDK.
